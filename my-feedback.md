## What do you think about the level?

I managed to complete the labs and liked the content and exercises a lot!!
But the thing that was going on inside each step / each Github Actions was not 100% crystal clear to me. In the sense that I’m not sure I understand everything that was going on.

I would suggest some kind of visual presentation right after each lab, like perhaps a diagram or drawing graphically summarizing what just happened in the lab we just did / just completed.

At some point I got confused with the whole container / upload / download / artifact / package / “component-test” / “performance-test” and think I kind of lost overview of what exactly I was doing - as the complexity inclined in the labs.
Of course, I know I will get further understanding when I use Github Actions from now on, and Sofus really taught us a lot + he did also recap after each lab! 

But a “visual lab recap” combined with the “vocal lab recap” Sofus did could help clarify even further and add some overview.

Thanks for a nice intro to Github Actions!



## Do you have ideas or suggestions for new courses and events?

Perhaps some more arround how github actions (CI) can be used in best practice regarding different environments (build locally), (deploy to test), (deploy to production), (if production deployment faills rollbaack to last working deploy..) and so on. Like a workshop doing an imaginary cloud app for a company or something.
That could be a good practical addition on top of the stuff we learned today!
